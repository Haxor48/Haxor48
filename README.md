## About Me

Hi!  I'm Connor, a Computer Science major, Statistics and Economics double minor at UC Irvine.  My main technical interests come through analyzing data, as well as recently I have gotten into reading about options trading, and the math that comes with that.  My GitHub will show some of the projects I have made either in school or on my own.
