# Welcome to My GitHub!

## About Me

Hi!  I'm Connor, a Computer Science major, Statistics and Economics double minor at UC Irvine.  My main technical interests come through analyzing data, as well as recently I have gotten into reading about options trading, and the math that comes with that.  My GitHub will show some of the projects I have made either in school or on my own.

## My Projects

### Websites

[Discoverify](https://github.com/Haxor48/discoverify)

A website where you can log in (doesn't currently work as I wasn't able to get approval for usage of the Spotify API) and view your most played artists and songs.  The website also recommends new artists via an algorithm, where you can like and dislike the recommended artists to further influence new recommended artists.

[Artificial Scout](https://github.com/Haxor48/mlb_predict)

A website that displays player and team statistics using the pybaseball API.  The website also then uses TensorFlow machine learning to predict future player stats using their past aggregate stats and more advanced batted/pitched ball data.

###Data Science

[2020 Election Data Aggregation](https://github.com/Haxor48/2020ElectionData)

A small project to practice Excel functions where I aggregated data from the 2020 Election, of which I got from MIT's election data page.  I looked at county, statewide, senate, congressional, presidential, etc data.

[NBA Players Return Write-up](https://github.com/Haxor48/nba-players-return)

A write-up I did using the nbastatR package where I did a what-if scenario where every NBA player returned to the original team with their draft pick. I analyzed which teams would improve, as well as covered and explained certain NBA statistics to a more common fan.

###Game Design

[Price Cut](https://github.com/Haxor48/InteractiveHorrorGame)

A game I worked on for a Senior year capstone project in High School with others.  This game was developed in Unity, in which you had places to go inside a grocery store, but you the player couldn't make too much noise to bring the enemy closer, as you had to manage the in and out of game noise levels to beat this horror game.

[50XM](https://github.com/Haxor48/50xx-the-mod)

This was a Smash Bros Ultimate mod I developed with others (though primarily by myself) in the language Rust.  I edited character and overall game mechanics to make the game more enjoyable for the players.
